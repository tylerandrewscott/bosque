## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The project requires the R statistical programming language, version 4.1.1 (2021-08-10). The project has not been tested on Windows, but it was developed jointly in OSX (11.4) and Linux. Some of the R packages required might require loading underlying dependencies (e.g., if you use the rgdal package, the GDAL and PROJ libraries must be installed).
