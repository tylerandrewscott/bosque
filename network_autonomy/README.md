# A Network Autonomy Framework: Reconceptualizing Special District Autonomy in Polycentric Systems

This repository subdirectory correspond to the following paper published in the Perspectives On Public Management and Govenrance (https://academic.oup.com/ppmg/article/3/1/59/5527217, https://doi.org/10.1093/ppmgov/gvz006). The bosque repository contains a variety of elements broadly related to the management and operations of water utilities in the United States, particularly the state of Texas. In this specific paper, we analyze the network of private consultants and contractors who provide services to multiple community water systems.

## Paper Abstract

The widespread proliferation of special districts and their role in producing and delivering public goods and services has been well documented. Each new entity further fragments government authority, and thus their autonomy is a critical determinant of how local governance systems function. Existing theories of special district autonomy emphasize formal institutional attributes such as election structure and state restrictions. We argue that this approach does not fully incorporate how relational dynamics such as functional interdependence, interest alignment, and social capital affect how special districts fit within regional polycentric governance systems. We propose a Network Autonomy Framework for local governments that focuses on relational dynamics between co-located1 governments and demonstrate an example of how this framework can be applied to a metropolitan region. By understanding how co-located governments relate to one another, we can gain a deeper understanding of special districtsâ€™ role in local governance systems and advance propositions as to how they will affect a variety of local policy outcomes.


## Getting Started

### Dependencies

* The project requires the R statistical programming language The project has not been tested on Windows. It was developed in OSX. Some of the R packages required might require loading underlying dependencies (e.g., if you use the rgdal package, the GDAL and PROJ libraries must be installed).
